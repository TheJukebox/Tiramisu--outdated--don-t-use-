NOTE: DO NOT DOWNLOAD REPO! IT'S NOT STABLE!

We're working here!

Right, so, changelog.

* Modified camera. Thirdperson camera now only follows the player when aiming, therefore allowing freescroll around the character when not moving. Fixed the over the shoulder camera so it's slightly more accurate.

* Rewrote clothing code.

* Added scaling for clothes. You can scale your body, head and hand size easily through the character editor.

* Added fix for when new fields are added/removed, CAKE.NilFix simply didn't do shit.

* Serverside flashlights

* Bugfixes on the Options menu.
